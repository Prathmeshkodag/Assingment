Tailwind CSS & Material UI: Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, providing flexibility in design with custom classes. Material UI is integrated for pre-built, customizable UI components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the app.

Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Features: The project leverages ES6+ features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and spread/rest operators to enhance code readability and maintainability.

React Router DOM: React Router DOM is used to manage client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different components (pages) without reloading the entire app.

sessionStorage: sessionStorage is used to store data temporarily on the client side, ensuring that the data persists across page refreshes but is cleared once the browser tab is closed.

Redux Toolkit: Redux Toolkit is implemented for state management, simplifying the process of handling global state in the app with features like slices, actions, and reducers.

Fetch API: Fetch API calls are used to make asynchronous requests to external servers or APIs, enabling data retrieval and interaction with backend systems.

React Function Components & Hooks: The app is built using React function components, and hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext are employed to manage state and side effects in a functional way.

Conditional Rendering: The project utilizes ternary operators and if conditions for efficient and dynamic rendering of components based on state or props.

Vercel Deployment: The frontend is deployed using Vercel, allowing for automatic deployment and scalability with minimal configuration.
